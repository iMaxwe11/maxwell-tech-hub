        <p>I started from scratch with Next.js and Tailwind.</p>
        <p>Then I layered in real tools: IP checker, clipboard tester, pong, password generator, blog pages, and newsletter signup â€” all custom-built.</p>
        <p>Every section was carefully designed to be useful, responsive, and personal.</p>
