        <p>Running a FiveM server taught me system management, uptime accountability, scripting, and even user support.</p>
        <p>I managed mod updates, backups, performance tuning, and remote restarts â€” all things that directly apply to IT operations today.</p>
        <p>It was my first real experience with full-stack responsibility and troubleshooting under pressure.</p>
